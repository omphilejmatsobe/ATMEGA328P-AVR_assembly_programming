# ATMEGA328P - AVR Assembly Programming

# Low Level Programming 

Let's learn AVR assembly progamming with ATMEGA328P microprocessor. This is the first step to learning low-level programming.

## Introduction

Assembly is a low-level programming language that is intended to communicate directly with a computer's hardware.
Processors only understand machine language instructions, 1's and 0's therefore machine language
is too complex for using in software development.
Low-level assembly language is designed for a specific processors that represents various 
instructions in symbolic code and a more understandable form.


## General
* Assembly is not fun, but is fun.
